The network layer is the practical implementation of the protocol rules. It establishes how communication is done between network participants, how data is shared and processed, and how it is validated to be included to the main ledger. It is formed of three major components: communication, transaction processing, and validation. 

## Communication 

This component specifies who can participate and access the network (open or closed), how data is shared between participants (public or private) and who has the authorization to initiate transactions (unrestricted or restricted). It is divided into three subsections: network access, data dissemination and transaction initiation.
